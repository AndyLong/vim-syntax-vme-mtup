This collection of files creates a syntax recognition system for the Message
Text Update Program, running on the ICL/Fujitsu VME operating system. 

The files in the 'template' folder are designed to be used with Luc Hermitte's
version of Gergely Kontra's mu-template system.

*** NOTE: These files are sill under development ***

The system is a bit simple-minded at the present - it makes a number of
simplifying assumptions:-

1. The command character is always '*' 2. Escape characters are angle brackets
('<' & '>')

'foldmethod' is set to syntax, and you can select folding to be carried out on
either (or both) of nested text strings (stuff between angle brackets) or on
conditional statements (CASE.. ESAC), although, by experience, I can't
recommend it for any file that is larger than a few dozen small texts. This is
probably due to the 'syntax sync fromstart' clause in the file, which is ther
because I don't grasp the difference between 'syntax sync' groups and
'ordinary' syntax groups in the 'syntax sync match' clauses :-(

If you want to experiment with it, then a pair of buffer-local variables drive
the two clauses that can be folded :-

b:mtup_fold_messages & b:mtup_fold_conditionals

which will inherit value from global variables of the same name, if set.
